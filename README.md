# About Me
About Me

Hi! I’m Nguyen My San, but you can call me Mia. I’m a Master’s student in Business Analytics at the University of the Pacific.
I am a international student and I am from Vietnam,Ho Chi Minh city. I am also taking an English class this semester to improve my English.

Studying in the U.S.A gives me a chance to grow academically and have more experience in new cultures.

I love Vietnamese food, especially Pho, because it reminds me of home. The warm broth and fresh herbs make me feel comforted and connected to my culture, even while I am studying abroad. I also enjoy trying new dishes in the U.S.A

In my free time, I like hanging out with my besties to go shopping and enjoy delicious food together.
