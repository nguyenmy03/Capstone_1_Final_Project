# About Me
About Me

Hi! I’m Nguyen My San, but you can call me Mia. I’m a Master’s student in Business Analytics at the University of the Pacific.
I am a international student and I am from Vietnam,Ho Chi Minh city. I am also taking an English class this semester to improve my English.

Studying in the U.S.A gives me a chance to grow academically and have more experience in new cultures.

I love Vietnamese food, especially Pho, because it reminds me of home. The warm broth and fresh herbs make me feel comforted and connected to my culture, even while I am studying abroad. I also enjoy trying new dishes in the U.S.A

In my free time, I like hanging out with my besties to go shopping and enjoy delicious food together. 


## Tell Me About Yourself (TMAY)
I was born and grew up in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. From May 2023 to 2024, I worked at Dream Viet Education company as a Business Assistant. In this job, I helped students choose learning paths, supported the sales team with campaigns, and managed student data by level, age, and their results for the academic team. I enjoyed this work because I could see how data and reports improved student learning and company strategy.
After working at Dream Viet, I thought I needed more knowledge and skills, so I decided to study abroad in the United States. Studying here has helped me a lot because improve my English, give me new experiences, and let me learn news tools for business.
In the summer of this year, I am a Teaching Assistant at the University of the Pacific’s Summer High School Institute. I helped students create digital media projects like blogs, vlogs, podcasts, and reels. This role helped me improve my communication, teamwork, and project management skills.
Now I am pursuing a Master of Business Analytics, where I study tools like JMP, Excel, Power BI, and GitLab to understand data and trends. In the future, I want to work in business analytics. I hope to learn more about collecting and analyzing data to support business. My long term goal is to grow into a role that combines analytics, communication, and leadership, so I can have a good career after graduation.
