# Project Planning A6

## 1. App idea
If I can create an app tomorrow that would sell to the world and my app name is **Math Helper**. It helps students learn and practice math easily. The app gives short lessons, examples, and fun quizzes. Students can see step-by-step answers when they make mistakes. People need it because many students feel scared of math. This app helps them learn at their own and feel more confident.

## 2. Current software tools used in class help me
GitLab helps me save my project files and share them with my classmates. Python helps me build the app logic and check math problems. BigQuery helps me store student scores and learning data. Grafana helps me make charts to show how students improve. APIs help the app connect with other tools. 

## 3. Data the app produces
The app will create data about each student’s progress. For example, it will save how many quizzes they finish, what topics they study, and their scores. It can also track how much time students spend learning each day. This data helps teachers and students see improvement.

## 4. Missing tools & what excites me
I think I need tools for app design to make the screen look nice. I am most excited about the analytics part because I like to see how data can show learning progress. It will be fun to use charts and reports to help students get better at Math.
